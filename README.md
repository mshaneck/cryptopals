This repository contains my files for the Cryptopals Crypto Challenge:
http://cryptopals.com/

They were created for my use, so you may need to do a bit of reverse engineering to get them to work properly. For most challenges, just calling the setXchallengeYY() function is enough top get it to run. Some require local servers to be run. I have also included some extra challenges based on certain "checkpoints" that I gave to my crypto class. 


TODO:
Finish challenge 24 - I never implemented the random password reset token seeded off current time with MT19937

Currently working on Challenge 53. 

The code is not the prettiest, but I have not had the time to clean it up. What I would like to do is expose most of the functionality behind a web app as a large online "calculator". Maybe someday...
