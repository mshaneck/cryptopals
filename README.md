TODO:
Finish challenge 24 - I never implemented the random password reset token seeded off current time with MT19937

Currently working on Challenge 53. 

The code is not the prettiest, but I have not had the time to clean it up. What I would like to do is expose most of the functionality behind a web app as a large online "calculator". Maybe someday...
